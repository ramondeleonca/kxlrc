I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
chorus
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
verse
And I wanna go out with you, where you wanna go? (Huh?)
Find a lil' spot, just sit and talk
Looking pretty, follow me, 우리 둘이 나란히
보이지? 내 눈이 갑자기 빛나지 when you say I'm your dream
pre-chorus
You don't even know my name, do you?
You don't even know my name, do you?
누구보다도
chorus
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
chorus
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
verse
나 원래 말도 잘하고 그런데 왜 이런지?
I don't like that
Something odd about you, yeah, you're special and you know it
You're the top, babe
chorus
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
chorus
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
hook
You don't even know my name, do you?
You don't even know my name, do you?
누구보다도

You don't even know my name (super shy, super shy)
Do you? (Make you mine, make you mine)
You don't even know my name (you're on my mind all the time, I wanna tell you)
Do you? (But I'm super shy, I'm super shy)
